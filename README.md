Comparing UK vs France Covid-19 death and vaccination trends from 2020-2021 using WHO data sets. 

**A Data Exploration of France vs United Kingdom Using SQL + Tableau:**
This project analyzes COVID-19 data for France and the United Kingdom to understand how government policies, vaccination progress, demographics, and medical response times influenced the spread and severity of COVID-19.

I used SQL for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, and Tableau to build interactive dashboards that visualize the most important trends.


**OBJECTIVES:**
Compare COVID-19 case trends and death trends between France and the UK

Analyze government policy stringency and its impact on deaths (lag analysis)

Assess vaccine rollout timelines and approval delays

Examine demographic differences like population, median age, and population density

Highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) to compare outcomes
